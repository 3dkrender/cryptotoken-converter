**EOS Coin Handler**

This python module is a **Coin Handler** for Privex's CryptoToken Converter, designed to handle all required
functionality for both receiving and sending Appics (APX) on the **EOS** network.

It will automatically handle any :class:`payments.models.Coin` which has it's type set to ``appics``

To use this handler, you must first create the base coin with symbol ``EOS``:

    Coin Name:  EOS
    Symbol:     EOS
    Our Account: (username of account used for sending/receiving native EOS token)
    Custom JSON: {"contract": "eosio.token"}

To change the RPC node from the admin panel, simply set the host/port/username/password on the EOS Coin:

    # Below are the defaults used if you don't configure the EOS coin:
    Host: eos.greymass.com
    Port: 443
    User: (leave blank)
    Pass: (leave blank)
    Custom JSON: {"ssl": True}
