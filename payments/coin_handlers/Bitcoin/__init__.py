**Bitcoind-based Coin Handler**

This python module is a **Coin Handler** for Privex's CryptoToken Converter, designed to handle all required
functionality for both receiving and sending any cryptocurrency which has a coin daemon that has a JSONRPC API
backwards compatible with `bitcoind`.

It will automatically handle any :class:`payments.models.Coin` which has it's type set to ``bitcoind``

**Coin object settings**:

    For each coin you intend to use with this handler, you should configure it as such:

    =============   ==================================================================================================
    Coin Key        Description
    =============   ==================================================================================================
    coin_type       This should be set to ``Bitcoind RPC compatible crypto`` (db value: bitcoind)
    setting_host    The IP or hostname for the daemon. If not specified, defaults to 127.0.0.1 / localhost
    setting_port    The RPC port for the daemon. If not specified, defaults to 8332
    setting_user    The rpcuser for the daemon. Generally MUST be specified.
    setting_pass    The rpcpassword for the daemon. Generally MUST be specified
    setting_json    A JSON string for optional extra config (see below)
    =============   ==================================================================================================


    Extra JSON (Handler Custom) config options:

    - ``confirms_needed`` Default 0; Amount of confirmations needed before loading a TX
    - ``use_trusted`` Default: True; If enabled, TXs returned from the daemon with 'trusted':true will always be
      accepted at 0 confs regardless of ``confirms_needed``
    - ``string_amt`` Default: True; If true, when sending coins, a ``Decimal`` will be used (as a string). This can
      cause problems with older coins such as Dogecoin, so for older coins that need floats, set this to False.

**Django Settings**:

    If you'd rather not store the RPC details in the database, you may specify them in Django's settings.py.

    If a coin symbol is specified in ``settings.COIND_RPC`` they will be used exclusively, and any handler settings
    on the Coin object will be ignored.

    If a settings key isn't specified, the default is the same as shown for coin object settings.

    Example COIND_RPC Setting::

        COIND_RPC = {
          "BTC": {
              'user': 'bitcoinrpc',
              'password': 'SuperSecurePass',
              'host':     '127.0.0.1',
              'port':     8332,
              'confirms_needed': 0,
              'string_amt': True,
              'use_trusted': True
          }
        }
