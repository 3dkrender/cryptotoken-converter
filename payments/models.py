"""

This file contains Models, classes which define database tables, and how they relate to each other.

Models are used for both querying the database, as well as inserting new rows and updating existing ones.

Models may also contain **properties** and **functions** to help make them easier to use.

Note: The ``coin_type`` choices tuple, ``COIN_TYPES`` is located in settings.py, and may be dynamically
altered by Coin Handlers. It does not enforce an enum on columns using it for ``choices`` , it's simply used for a
dropdown list in the admin panel.
