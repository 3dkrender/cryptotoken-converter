**Bitshares Coin Handler**

This python module is a **Coin Handler** for Privex's CryptoToken Converter, designed to handle all required
functionality for both receiving and sending tokens on the **Bitshares** network.

It will automatically handle any :class:`payments.models.Coin` which has its type set to ``bitshares``
