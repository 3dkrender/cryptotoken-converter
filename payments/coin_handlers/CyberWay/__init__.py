**CyberWay Coin Handler**

This python module is a **Coin Handler** for Privex's CryptoToken Converter, designed to handle all required
functionality for both receiving and sending tokens on the **CyberWay** network.

It will automatically handle any :class:`payments.models.Coin` which has it's type set to ``cyberway``

To use this handler, you must first create the base coin with symbol ``CYBER``::

    Coin Name:  CyberWay
    Symbol:     CYBER
    Our Account: (username of account used for sending/receiving native CYBER token)
    Custom JSON: {"contract": "cyber.token"}

To change the RPC node from the admin panel, simply set the host/port/username/password on the CYBER Coin::

    # Below are the defaults used if you don't configure the CYBER coin::
    Host: node.stihi.io
    Port: 443
    User: (leave blank)
    Pass: (leave blank)
    Custom JSON: {"ssl": True}



**Coin Settings (Custom JSON settings)**
    
    .. Tip::  You can override the defaults for all CyberWay coins by setting the ``settings_json`` for a coin with the symbol ``CYBER``.
              
              All :class:`.Coin`'s handled by the CyberWay handler will inherit the ``CYBER`` coin's custom JSON settings, which can be
              overrided via the individual coin's ``settings_json``.
    
    You can set the following JSON keys inside of a :class:`.Coin`'s "settings_json" field to adjust settings such as the
    "contract account" for the token, whether or not to use SSL with the RPC node, as well as the precision (DP) of the coin, if
    it's different from the default of ``4`` decimal places.
