**Hive Coin Handler**

This python module is a **Coin Handler** for Privex's CryptoToken Converter, designed to handle all required
functionality for both receiving and sending tokens on the **Hive** network.

It will automatically handle any :class:`payments.models.Coin` which has it's type set to ``hivebase``

**Coin object settings**:

    For each :class:`payments.models.Coin` you intend to use with this handler, you should configure it as such:

    =============   ==================================================================================================
    Coin Key        Description
    =============   ==================================================================================================
    coin_type       This should be set to ``Hive Network (or compatible fork)`` (db value: hivebase)
    our_account     This should be set to the username of the account you want to use for receiving/sending
    setting_json    A JSON string for optional extra config (see below)
    =============   ==================================================================================================

    Extra JSON (Handler Custom) config options:

    - ``rpcs`` - A JSON list<str> of RPC nodes to use, with a full HTTP/HTTPS URL. If this is not specified, Beem
      will automatically try to use the best available RPC node for the Hive network.
    - ``pass_store`` - Generally you do not need to touch this. It controls where Beem will look for the wallet
      password. It defaults to ``environment``

    Example JSON custom config::

        {
            "rpcs": [
                "https://steemd.privex.io",
                "https://api.steemit.com",
                "https://api.steem.house"
            ],
            "pass_store": "environment"
        }
