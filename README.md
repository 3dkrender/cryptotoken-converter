# CryptoToken Converter by Privex

[![Developed by Privex Banner](https://www.privex.io/static/assets/svg/privex_ctc_api.svg)](https://www.privex.io)

CryptoToken Converter is a Python web application designed to allow anyone to run their own conversion service
between two or more cryptocurrencies/tokens.

It has been developed to be highly modular and customizable, with a REST API for easy integration into your own
user interfaces, services, and automated scripts (bots). 

**This project is currently in beta stage, some things may not be finished, or lack clear documentation**

[![Read the Documentation](https://read-the-docs-guidelines.readthedocs-hosted.com/_images/logo-wordmark-dark.png)](
https://cryptotoken-converter.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)

Full documentation for this project is available above (click the Read The Docs image), including:

 - How to install the application and it's dependencies 
 - How to configure it properly
 - How to add your own Coin Handler for new cryptocurrency/token support 
 - General documentation of the modules and classes for contributors

The documentation is written in reStructured Text, with compilation to HTML and automatically generated 
class/module docs using Sphinx.

# Quickstart

```bash
# If you don't already have pipenv installed
pip3 install pipenv

git clone https://github.com/Privex/cryptotoken-converter.git
cd cryptotoken-converter

pipenv install

touch .env
chmod 700 .env
# Open .env in a text editor and configure as needed

./run.sh migrate
./run.sh createsuperuser

# Use 'dev' for development only, do not use in production!
./run.sh dev

# For production, use gunicorn via 'serve' or 'prod'
./run.sh serve

```

Example .env file:

```
DB_BACKEND=postgresql
DB_USER=steemengine_pay
DB_PASS=MySuperSecretPassword
DB_NAME=steemengine
DEBUG=false
SECRET_KEY=VeryLongRandomStringUsedToProtectYourUserSessions
UNLOCK=

# License

This project is licensed under the **GNU AGPL v3**

For full details, please see `LICENSE.txt` and `AGPL-3.0.txt`.

Here's the important parts:

 - If you use this software (or substantial parts of it) to run a public service (including any separate user interfaces 
   which use it's API), **you must display a link to this software's source code wherever it is used**.
   
   Example: **This website uses the open source [CryptoToken Converter](https://github.com/Privex/cryptotoken-converter)
   created by [Privex Inc.](https://www.privex.io)**
   
 - If you modify this software (or substantial portions of it) and make it available to the public in some 
   form (whether it's just the source code, running it as a public service, or part of one) 
    - The modified software (or portion) must remain under the GNU AGPL v3, i.e. same rules apply, public services must
      display a link back to the modified source code.
    - You must attribute us as the original authors, with a link back to the original source code
    - You must keep our copyright notice intact in the LICENSE.txt file

 - Some people interpret the GNU AGPL v3 "linking" rules to mean that you must release any application that interacts
   with our project under the GNU AGPL v3.
   
   To clarify our stance on those rules: 
   
   - If you have a completely separate application which simply sends API requests to a copy of CryptoToken Converter
     that you run, you do not have to release your application under the GNU AGPL v3. 
   - However, you ARE required to place a notice on your application, informing your users that your application
     uses Cryptotoken Converter, with a clear link to the source code (see our example at the top)
   - If your application's source code **is inside of CryptoToken Converter**, i.e. you've added your own Python
     views, templates etc. to a copy of this project, then your application is considered a modification of this
     software, and thus you DO have to release your source code under the GNU AGPL v3.

 - There is no warranty. We're not responsible if you, or others incur any damages from using this software.
 
 - If you can't / don't want to comply with these license requirements, or are unsure about how it may affect
   your particular usage of the software, please [contact us](https://www.privex.io/contact/). 
   We may offer alternative licensing for parts of, or all of this software at our discretion.

# Building the Documentation

If you'd like to contribute to the documentation, it's included in this repo.

Before you can build the documentation, you'll need to at the very least install the Python dependencies for the 
main project with `pip3 install -r requirements.txt`

To build the documentation, first enter the `docs` folder and install the documentation python packages (they're not
included in the main project requirements.txt as they're only needed for the docs)

```bash
cd docs/
# Install all requirements, plus development/documentation requirements
pipenv install --dev
```

For development purposes, we've included [sphinx-autobuild](https://github.com/GaretJax/sphinx-autobuild), which
automatically re-builds the documentation when you change it, and also offers auto-refresh if you access the docs
via the webserver at http://127.0.0.1:8100

To build the documentation with automatic re-building on edit, plus auto-reload:

```bash
# Run sphinx autobuild
make live
```

To build the documentation normally, run the following:

```bash
# Clean out the previous html files, and then re-build them fresh
make clean; make html
```

If you encounter any strangeness, such as items missing from the left navigation bar, or content not showing up,
you should make sure to run `make clean` to ensure the HTML files are re-built from fresh.

# Contributing

We're very happy to accept pull requests, and work on any issues reported to us. 

Here's some important information:

**Reporting Issues:**

 - For bug reports, you should include the following information:
     - Version of the project you're using - `git log -n1`
     - The Python package versions you have installed - `pip3 freeze`
     - Your python3 version - `python3 -V`
     - Your operating system and OS version (e.g. Ubuntu 18.04, Debian 7)
 - For feature requests / changes
     - Clearly explain the feature/change that you would like to be added
     - Explain why the feature/change would be useful to us, or other users of the tool
     - Be aware that features/changes that are complicated to add, or we simply find un-necessary for our use of the tool 
       may not be added (but we may accept PRs)
    
**Pull Requests:**

 - We'll happily accept PRs that only add code comments or README changes
 - Use 4 spaces, not tabs when contributing to the code
 - You can use features from Python 3.4+ (we run Python 3.7+ for our projects)
    - Features that require a Python version that has not yet been released for the latest stable release
      of Ubuntu Server LTS (at this time, Ubuntu 18.04 Bionic) will not be accepted. 
 - Clearly explain the purpose of your pull request in the title and description
     - What changes have you made?
     - Why have you made these changes?
 - Please make sure that code contributions are appropriately commented - we won't accept changes that involve 
   uncommented, highly terse one-liners.

**Legal Disclaimer for Contributions**

Nobody wants to read a long document filled with legal text, so we've summed up the important parts here.

If you contribute content that you've created/own to projects that are created/owned by Privex, such as code or 
documentation, then you might automatically grant us unrestricted usage of your content, regardless of the open source 
license that applies to our project.

If you don't want to grant us unlimited usage of your content, you should make sure to place your content
in a separate file, making sure that the license of your content is clearly displayed at the start of the file 
(e.g. code comments), or inside of it's containing folder (e.g. a file named LICENSE). 

You should let us know in your pull request or issue that you've included files which are licensed
separately, so that we can make sure there's no license conflicts that might stop us being able
to accept your contribution.

If you'd rather read the whole legal text, it should be included as `privex_contribution_agreement.txt`.
